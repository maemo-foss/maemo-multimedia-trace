Filters are of the form <expr1 expr2 ... exprn>. Every expression is
of the form <tag=value> where value can be a simple string or a regexp.

A trace message is passed through if it matches any of the filters. A
message matches a filter if its associated set of tags match the filter.
A set of tags match a filter if every expression of the filter is satisfied
by at least one tag. In other words, a filter is the boolean AND of its
expressions and the global filtering state/configuration is the logical OR
of all the filters.


trace add filter user=foo
trace add filter from=+123456 to=+987654
trace add filter srcaddr=10.0.0.40
trace add filter srcaddr=10.0.0.40 srcport=5060

trace test.fibonacci=+fibonacci
trace test.prime=+loop
trace test.test=+calls,+loop

(Filters are sorted and evaluated by increasing number of expressions as
 the fewer expressions the lighter is to evaluate a filter and the more
 probable it is to match a message (at least in theory).)
